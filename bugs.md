# Bug Fixes

## âœ… Fixed Issues:
- ~~white player seems to win automatically, logic?~~ **FIXED**: Corrected player indexing and win condition logic
- ~~unique colors for every area of the board, all six sides~~ **FIXED**: Each player's selected color now appears in their home zone
- ~~remove animation entirely from the game board? ( area around board )~~ **FIXED**: Removed boardGlow animation
- ~~crashes after player selects white 2 > players~~ **FIXED**: Fixed multi-player setup to handle any number of players correctly

## ðŸ”§ Technical Fixes Applied:
1. **Multi-player Setup**: Now properly handles 2, 3, 4, and 6 player games with sequential setup
2. **Color Selection**: Each player can select their own color and it appears in their board zones
3. **Player Indexing**: Fixed the confusion between board positions and player indices
4. **Board Layout**: Players are positioned logically based on game size (opposite corners for 2p, etc.)
5. **Animation Removal**: Removed distracting board glow animation as requested
